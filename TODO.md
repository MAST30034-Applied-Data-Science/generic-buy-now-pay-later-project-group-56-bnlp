# ====  Week 2 Sprint
- Product: SHORT NOTEBOOK
  - outlier analysis
  - generate insights


* If you found NULL values after you joined the datasets, what did you do with them? How many were there?
* Was there any missing data that shouldnâ€™t be missing after joining to your external dataset? If anything was missing, how much was there and what did you do about it?
* If you decided to omit outliers, what does the distribution look like prior and after?


- ANOVA between Income (external datasets) and Industries
